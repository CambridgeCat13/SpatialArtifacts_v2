Description: SpatialDryArtifacts implements enhanced methods for detecting edge dryspots - 
    technical artifacts caused by incomplete reagent coverage during Visium spatial transcriptomics sample preparation. 
    This package extends existing spatial transcriptomics quality control methods by incorporating spatial neighborhood information. 
    It provides a two-step workflow to identify, classify, and 
    handle edge dryspot artifacts in 10x Visium data. These artifacts, 
    often appearing as areas of low gene and UMI counts at tissue edges, 
    can negatively impact downstream analyses.
